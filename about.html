        <h2>Why I built True Do</h2> 
        <br>
        <p>
            True Do started as a <span class="green">passion project</span> to solve a <span class="green">simple problem</span> I had - 
            A simple everyday To-Do app, which was <span class="green">clean</span>, <span class="green">easy to use</span> and <span class="green">pleasing</span> to look at!
            I wanted to build <span class="green">True Do</span> as a commercial app to gain experience in building <span class="green">APIs</span> and <span class="green">Websites</span>.
            This has been a very fun experience for me. I've learnt a lot as well as getting to know how APIs work. The API itself took around <span class="green">2 months</span> to make!
            There were moments where I was banging my head against the wall, but then after taking a break, I would tackle the problem with a clear head.
        </p> 
        <br> 
        <br>

        <p>IT is a very simple app, but for me, that's the beauty of it - <span class="green">the simplicity!</span></p>
